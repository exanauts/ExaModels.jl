!!! warning
	**Please help us improve ExaModels and this documentation!** ExaModels is in the early stage of development, and you may encounter unintended behaviors or missing documentations. If you find anything is not working as intended or documentation is missing, please [open issues](https://github.com/sshin/ExaModels.jl/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/sshin/ExaModels.jl/pulls) or start [discussions](https://github.com/sshin/ExaModels.jl/discussions). 

## What is ExaModels.jl?
ExaModels.jl is an [algebraic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_modeling_language) and [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) tool in [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/), specialized for [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) abstraction of [nonlinear programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming). ExaModels.jl employs what we call [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) abstraction for [nonlinear programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming) (NLPs), which allows for the preservation of the parallelizable structure within the model equations, facilitating efficient [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) either on the single-thread CPUs, multi-threaded CPUs, as well as [GPU accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit). More details about SIMD abstraction can be found [here](@ref simd).

## Key differences from other algebraic modeling tools
ExaModels.jl is different from other algebraic modeling tools, such as [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) or [AMPL](https://ampl.com/), in the following ways:
- **Modeling Interface**: ExaModels.jl requires users to specify the model equations always in the form of `Generator`s. This restrictive structure allows ExaModels.jl to preserve the SIMD-compatible structure in the model equations. This unique feature distinguishes ExaModels.jl from other algebraic modeling tools.
- **Performance**: ExaModels.jl compiles (via Julia's compiler) derivative evaluation codes tailored to each computation pattern. Through reverse-mode automatic differentiation using these tailored codes, ExaModels.jl achieves significantly faster derivative evaluation speeds, even when using CPU.
- **Portability**: ExaModels.jl goes beyond traditional boundaries of
algebraic modeling systems by **enabling derivative evaluation on GPU
accelerators**. Implementation of GPU kernels is accomplished using
the portable programming paradigm offered by
[KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl).
With ExaModels.jl, you can run your code on various devices, including
multi-threaded CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and Intel GPUs. Note that
Apple's Metal is currently not supported due to its lack of support
for double-precision arithmetic.

Thus, ExaModels.jl shines when your model has
- nonlinear objective and constraints;
- a large number of variables and constraints;
- highly repetitive structure;
- sparse Hessian and Jacobian.
These features are often exhibited in optimization problems associated with first-principle physics-based models. Primary examples include optimal control problems formulated with direct subscription method [biegler2010nonlinear](@cite) and network system optimization problems, such as optimal power flow [coffrin2018powermodels](@cite) and gas network control/estimation problems.

## Performance Highlights
ExaModels.jl significantly enhances the performance of
derivative evaluations for nonlinear optimization problems that can
benefit from SIMD abstraction. Recent benchmark results demonstrate
this notable improvement. Notably, when solving the AC OPF problem for
a 9241 bus system, derivative evaluation using ExaModels.jl on GPUs
can be up to two orders of magnitude faster compared to JuMP or
AMPL. Some benchmark results are available below. The following 
problems are used for benchmarking:
- [LuksanVlcek problem](@ref guide)
- [Quadrotor control problem](@ref quad)
- [Distillation column control problem](@ref distillation)
- [AC optimal power flow problem](@ref opf)

## Supported Solvers
ExaModels can be used with any solver that can handle `NLPModel` data type, but several callbacks are not currently implemented, and cause some errors. Currently, it is tested with the following solvers:
- [Ipopt](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModelsIpopt.jl) (via [NLPModelsIpopt.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModelsIpopt.jl))
- [MadNLP.jl](https://github.com/MadNLP/MadNLP.jl)

## Documentation Structure
This documentation is structured in the following way.
- The remainder of this page highlights several key aspects of ExaModels.jl.
- The mathematical abstraction---SIMD abstraction of nonlinear programming---of ExaModels.jl is discussed in [Mathematical Abstraction page](@ref simd).
- The step-by-step tutorial of using ExaModels.jl can be found in [Tutorial page](@ref guide).
- This documentation does not intend to discuss the engineering behind the implementation of ExaModels.jl. Some high-level idea is discussed in [a recent publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16830), but the full details of the engineering behind it will be discussed in the future publications.
