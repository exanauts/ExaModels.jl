# What is ExaModels?
ExaModels.jl implements SIMD abstraction of nonlinear programs and the automatic differentiation of its functions. ExaModels.jl expresses the functions in the form of iterables over statically typed data. This allows highly efficient derivative computations based on reverse-mode automatic differentiation.
