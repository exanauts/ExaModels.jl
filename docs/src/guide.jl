# # Getting Started
# ExaModels can create nonlinear prgogramming models and allows solving the created models using NLP solvers (in particular, those that are interfaced with `NLPModels`, such as [NLPModelsIpopt](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModelsIpopt.jl). We now use `ExaModels` to model the following nonlinear program:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \min_{\{x_i\}_{i=0}^N} &\sum_{i=2}^N  100(x_{i-1}^2-x_i)^2+(x_{i-1}-1)^2\\
# \text{s.t.} &  3x_{i+1}^3+2x_{i+2}-5+\sin(x_{i+1}-x_{i+2})\sin(x_{i+1}+x_{i+2})+4x_{i+1}-x_i e^{x_i-x_{i+1}}-3 = 0
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# We model the problem with:
using ExaModels

# We set
N = 10000

# First, we create a `ExaModels.Core`.
c = ExaModels.Core()

# The variables can be created as follows:

x = ExaModels.variable(
    c, N;
    start = (mod(i,2)==1 ? -1.2 : 1. for i=1:N)
)

# The objective can be set as follows:
ExaModels.objective(c, 100*(x[i-1]^2-x[i])^2+(x[i-1]-1)^2 for i in 2:N)

# The constraints can be set as follows:
ExaModels.constraint(
    c,
    3x[i+1]^3+2*x[i+2]-5+sin(x[i+1]-x[i+2])sin(x[i+1]+x[i+2])+4x[i+1]-x[i]exp(x[i]-x[i+1])-3
    for i in 1:N-2)

# Finally, we create an NLPModel.
m = ExaModels.Model(c)

# To solve the problem with `Ipopt`,
using NLPModelsIpopt
sol = ipopt(m);

# The solution `sol` contains the field `sol.solution` holding the optimized parameters.
