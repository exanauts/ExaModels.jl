# ── Symbolic build-time arguments ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# An `ExaCore` is normally built from data already in hand, so the model and its
# data are finished together and cannot be separated afterwards.  That is fine
# until you want to compile the model ahead of time.
#
# Ahead-of-time compilation needs the opposite arrangement: the *structure* has
# to become code, while the *data* stays a run-time input.  Nothing stopped a
# user writing their own builder and pointing `juliac` at it, but
# `--trim=safe` requires the whole call graph to resolve statically, and which
# modelling constructs survive that is not something a model author can see
# while writing.  The usual way to find out is to compile, read a trimming
# error naming an inferred type somewhere in the machinery, and guess.
#
# A recipe removes the question.  Writing a model against `ArgSource`
# placeholders *is* the separation that compilation requires: what stays in the
# core becomes code, what goes into the arguments crosses the boundary as data.
# A recipe that builds and instantiates is on the compilation pathway, and the
# author never reasons about trimming.  `ExaModelsC` takes it from there —
# shared library, C ABI, consumed by CNLPModels.jl or cnlpmodels.
#
# The same mechanism happens to make one core reusable at any size, which is
# convenient, but it is a consequence rather than the motivation.
#
# ── HOW IT RELATES TO DataSource ──
#
# `ArgSource` borrows `DataSource`'s *encoding* — a sentinel whose field/index
# access returns a node carrying the access path in a type parameter, so the
# lookup compiles away — but the two are different ideas, and it is worth being
# precise about which is which.
#
#   DataSource  — the PARAMETERIZATION of an algebraic pattern.  One expression
#                 tree stands for many constraint rows or objective terms, and
#                 the data point is what that tree is parameterized by: it is
#                 bound afresh on every kernel iteration, as `node(i, x, θ)`.
#                 Nothing is missing from such a tree; it is complete, and being
#                 evaluated repeatedly is the whole point.
#
#   ArgSource   — a genuine PLACEHOLDER.  It stands for a quantity not yet known
#                 while the model is being written — a size, a starting point, a
#                 bound, the set a generator runs over.  It is substituted once,
#                 by `instantiate(node, arg)`, and is gone afterwards: nothing
#                 ever evaluates it.  It lives in the slots the expression graph
#                 is built *from*, not inside the graph.
#
# So a core carrying `DataSource` nodes is a finished model; a core carrying
# `ArgSource` nodes is a recipe for one.
#
# This lets an `ExaCore` be written against arguments that are not yet known:
#
#     @add_var(c, x, arg.N; start = arg.v)
#     @add_con(c, x[i]^2 for i in 1:arg.N; lcon = 0.0, ucon = arg.nh * ones(10))
#
# and instantiated later.  Anything with no `ArgSource` in it is passed through
# by `instantiate` untouched, so ordinary (non-symbolic) models are unaffected.

"""
    AbstractArgNode

Root type for the symbolic *argument* expression tree.  Nodes are built by
ordinary Julia operations on an [`ArgSource`](@ref) (`arg.N`, `length(arg.v)`,
`arg.nh * zeros(10)`, `1:arg.N`, …) and are resolved to concrete
values by [`instantiate`](@ref).
"""
abstract type AbstractArgNode end

"""
    ArgSource <: AbstractArgNode

Sentinel node standing for the whole argument object supplied at instantiation
time.  Field access or indexing returns an [`ArgIndexed`](@ref) node.

Create one where you need it and give it whatever name reads best — it carries
no state, so every instance is interchangeable:

```julia
arg = ArgSource()
@add_var(c, x, arg.N; start = arg.x0)
```
"""
struct ArgSource{K} <: AbstractArgNode end

@inline ArgSource() = ArgSource{1}()

"""
    ArgIndexed{I, J} <: AbstractArgNode

The lookup `inner.J` (or `inner[J]`) where `inner` is an [`ArgSource`](@ref) or
another `ArgIndexed`.  `J` is a type parameter, so `getproperty` / `getindex`
resolves at compile time — the same encoding [`DataIndexed`](@ref) uses.
"""

end
@inline ArgIndexed(inner::I, j) where {I} = ArgIndexed{I, j}(inner)

"""
    ArgNode1{F, I} <: AbstractArgNode

A unary operation `f(inner)` deferred until instantiation.  `f` is stored as a
field; for the singleton function types this always holds in practice, that
field is zero-size and the call is statically resolved.
"""
struct ArgNode1{F, I} <: AbstractArgNode
    f::F
    inner::I
end

"""
    ArgNode2{F, I1, I2} <: AbstractArgNode

A binary operation `f(inner1, inner2)` deferred until instantiation.  Either
child may be a plain value (a `Number`, an `AbstractArray`, …) so that mixed
expressions such as `arg.nh * zeros(10)` are representable.
"""

    f::F
    inner1::I1
    inner2::I2
end

"""
    ArgCall{F, A} <: AbstractArgNode

A deferred call `f(args...)` of arbitrary arity.  `ArgNode1` / `ArgNode2` cover
the operator cases that users write and print nicely; `ArgCall` is what the
model-building internals use when an existing helper simply needs to run later
against instantiated inputs.

`args` is always a `Tuple`, and is written out at every call site.  A varargs
constructor would be shadowed by the default two-field one for the arity-1 case
— `ArgCall(f, x)` would quietly store `x` itself rather than `(x,)` — so there
deliberately isn't one.

# ── Instantiation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"""
    instantiate(x, args...)

Resolve every [`AbstractArgNode`](@ref) inside `x` against the concrete
argument objects `args`, and return the resulting value.  An
[`ArgSource`](@ref)`{K}` resolves to `args[K]`, so the order here is the order
the placeholders came out of [`ExaCore`](@ref).

`instantiate` is the identity on anything that carries no `ArgSource`
dependency — including containers, which are returned unchanged (`===`) rather
than rebuilt — so it is safe to apply to every slot of a model unconditionally.

## Example
```jldoctest
julia> using ExaModels

julia> arg = ArgSource();

julia> ExaModels.instantiate(arg.nh * ones(3), (nh = 2,))
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 2.0
 2.0
 2.0

julia> x = [1.0, 2.0];

julia> ExaModels.instantiate(x, (nh = 2,)) === x     # identity, no arg dependency
true

`Val(true)` if any of `xs` is an [`AbstractArgNode`](@ref), `Val(false)`

build-time operation.

Resolved entirely by dispatch: each method returns a literal `Val`, and the
recursion is over the argument list, so the answer is part of the method
signature rather than a `Bool` that inference has to fold.  That matters for
`juliac --trim=safe`, where a `Val(::Bool)` built from a runtime value would
leave the choice — and both branches' return types — unresolved.
