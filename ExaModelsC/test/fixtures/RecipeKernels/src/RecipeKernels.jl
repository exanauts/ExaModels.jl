    RecipeKernels

A stand-in for a modelling library, in the one respect that matters here: it
owns a function that ends up *inside* a recipe rather than beside it.

A starting point that varies with the index cannot be a number in the core, and
the size it runs over is not known while the structure is written — so it is
deferred, and the deferred thing is a function this package wrote.  The core
that comes out therefore names a `RecipeKernels` type, and a process that
cannot load `RecipeKernels` cannot read that core back.

The functions are deliberately named rather than anonymous: a `Base.Generator`
over `alternating` carries `typeof(alternating)`, which is stable across
recompiles, whereas a closure carries a gensym that is not.
